## 🚀 Usage Walkthrough

1.  **Register:** Navigate to the `/register` page. Create a new account by providing your full name, a valid email address, and a strong password (meeting the specified criteria).
2.  **Login:** Go to the `/login` page. Access your KhaataBook dashboard using your registered email and password.
3.  **Password Reset (if needed):** If you forget your password, use the "Forgot Password" link (typically on the login page). You'll be asked to provide your email and username to initiate the reset process.
4.  **Dashboard (Home Page):**
    * View a list of all your created "hisaabs."
    * Utilize the filter options to sort by date or view records based on their creation time (Newest/Oldest).
5.  **Create Hisaab:**
    * Click the "Create Hisaab" link in the navigation.
    * Fill in the form with a unique filename, a descriptive title, and the main content for your hisaab.
    * Choose whether to make the hisaab shareable (this might be a future feature or a simple flag).
    * Opt to encrypt the hisaab by checking the "Encrypted File?" box and providing a secure password (minimum 5 characters).
6.  **View Hisaab:**
    * Click on a hisaab title from the dashboard.
    * If the hisaab is encrypted, you will be prompted to enter the correct password to unlock and view its content.
    * The page displays the hisaab's title, detailed content, creation date, and status (encrypted/shareable).
7.  **Edit Hisaab:**
    * From the "View Hisaab" page, or directly from the dashboard (for encrypted files, you might need to unlock first if editing settings), click the "Edit" button.
    * You can modify the hisaab's title, its content, and its shareable/encrypted status. If changing encryption settings or updating an encrypted file's password, you'll interact with the password field accordingly.
8.  **Delete Hisaab:**
    * Hisaabs can be deleted from the "View Hisaab" page or directly from the dashboard. A confirmation prompt will appear to prevent accidental deletions.
9.  **Theme Toggle:**
